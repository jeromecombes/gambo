Bukacek-Frazier	Jaimeson	Yes	Yes		I studied abroad in Qingdao, China from May 30, 2016 - July 30, 2016.	I spent one week of my study abroad in China with a host family. It was actually a rather bad time; they lived over an hour from the school, and the mother expected me to teach her son English rather than use the homestay as an opportunity to improve my Mandarin.	I stay with a family of 4 siblings (only three of whom live at the house) on holidays. My own family consists of my father and my 6 siblings, though only three of them are young enough to still live with my father.	Yes	Yes	No	I am not comfortable cooking for myself, though I would be open to helping the family make meals.  - Additionally, I am a rather independent person. I know that discussion of a curfew is outlined in the Essential Housing Information, and I would inform my host family before I stayed out late. However, I wanted to reiterate that staying out and experiencing Paris with friends is something I plan on doing often, and I would not want that to be a source of contention.	My main reason for studying abroad in Paris is really to improve my French. Studying abroad in China improved my Mandarin abilities exponentially in the two months I was there, and I would like to make my French abilities as good as possible before I leave.	My main academic interests are math / science and languages. I'm a Chemistry / Chinese double major.	I participate in Vassar's circus troupe and a dance organization. I also really enjoy working out. - I know this is more of an occupational thing than a "leisure time interest" but most of the jobs I have had have involved working with children (babysitter, camp counselor, etc.), and I would love to have host-siblings while in France.	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	NA	I currently only eat meat 2-3 times a week, and would not at all mind living with a vegetarian family.	No	NA	I am queer, and would need to live with a family where that wouldn't be an issue.			I love children and would love to have host-sibling(s) be they around my age or much younger. I also love pets (specifically dogs). - I would describe myself as rather neat - my floor is never dirty but my desk is never clean. - I'm a very light sleeper; I need a quiet / dark room in order to fall asleep. - My study habits are flexible. I have no special routines / requirements for getting work done.
Docher	Jenna	Yes	Yes		My father grew up in France, and the entirety of his immediate and extended family still lives there, primarily in a village called Tinlhat, Clermont-Ferrand, Lyon, and Montpellier. I have visited them five times in my life for periods of 3-4 weeks, the most recent visit being the summer before my Freshman year of college. As part of those trips, I have also been able to visit Stockholm, Copenhagen, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny, London, Rome, Florence, and Venice with my family. I also spent six weeks in Seoul on the NSLI-Y program (US Dept of State--National Security Language Initiative for Youth) during the summer after my junior year of high school, and two weeks in Nova Scotia on vacation with my family.	Included in the NSLI-Y program was a homestay. However, my host family, having hosted for NSLI-Y before, was not thoroughly checked the summer I went, and thus provided an experience that was significantly below program standards (to the extent that mid-program they were inspected and told to make significant changes). The host family requirements were quite similar to those of VWPP, except my host family was halfway through moving into a new apartment, so there was only a mini fridge, the meals they provided consisted primarily of instant ramen, and there was no TV, computer, wifi, or bed. My host sister was in the midst of her university entrance exams and thus couldn't spend time with me, and my host mother was working full time. The apartment was also infested with mosquitoes.  -   - Honestly (really--I know it sounds crazy), these things didn't bother me very much, because I was just sincerely elated to be able to spend time in Seoul at all (which is why I didn't say anything to my program directors until we were more than halfway through the summer). What was most important to me was that the apartment was close to a metro station, as well as to a bakery and a grocery store, and that the neighborhood was safe to walk around in at night. Because my host family was very "hands-off," I spent all of my free time either exploring the city on my own (which I LOVED--10/10 would repeat), or going on adventures with Korean and American friends I'd made in other ways. I'd love to be able to take a shower without being eaten alive by mosquitoes, but my expectations really aren't too high--I prioritize being close to a metro station, being in a safe-ish neighborhood (I like to go running at night when it's nice out), being close to good/cheap food, and living with people I can cook with/talk to far above creature comforts.	My parents both grew up in lower middle-class families, my mother in Brooklyn, my father in Tinlhat, France. My mother joined the Peace Corps after completing her BA in Psychology at Vassar; my father opted for the alternative to the (then-mandatory) French military service. They thus met in the Central African Republic, where they lived for three years, and then proceeded to spend a year traveling West Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, as well as six months living in Montpellier, before settling in Northern California, where my mother completed her MSW at UC Berkeley. My father (53) now works as an assistant winemaker at Chappellet Winery, where he makes wine, writes databases, and pursues a variety of mechanical engineering projects; my mother (55) works freelance giving parenting classes and lectures on gifted education. My younger sister is 15 and spends most of her free time dancing and playing cello. I was thus raised to appreciate experiences over material items, and to love art, literature, cooking, eating, photography, and intellectual discourse. All together, we enjoy going to art/photography museums and dance shows, hearing classical music, eating, and cooking.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I spent last summer living on campus at Vassar in a TH with four other people I didn't know very well. It was a wonderful experience--I had my own space to pursue my art/photography, but also had a communal space to cook and talk with my housemates, whom I came to like very much. Cooking for my housemates and having lingering conversations over food about our respective summer projects (and lives, in general) was actually one of the highlights of my summer. I would love to live with people who also love to cook, or at least live with people who love to eat, who would allow me to cook for them. I would also love to live with people who have some interest(s) in common with me, because I think that being able to talk about art or something over food would really help me to develop my ability to talk about my interests in French, in addition to just making the famille d'acceuil experience more pleasant. -  - Although I love to cook collaboratively, I enjoy having independence with transportation--I'd really rather not be reliant on someone to drive me places, as I am back home in California, and as I was over the summer. I also very much appreciate people who clean up after themselves--I am good at cleaning my own spaces, and rather expect other people to do the same (this is more relevant with housemates than with a host family).	My main reason for coming to Paris is that I am half French and feel that being fully bilingual would fill a crucial gap in my cultural identity. I chose VWPP (and IFE, which I plan on doing in the spring) because I felt that it was the best fit in terms of the balance between academics, cultural opportunities, support, and freedom. I think it will be fascinating for me specifically to spend time in Paris because my experiences with French culture are very much more of the pastoral, "old France;" I've only spent at most a few days at a time in Paris. As someone who loves art, music, fashion, food, and photography, I think I will have an amazing time.	I am pursuing a double major in French and Philosophy, with additional interests in art, photography, cognitive science, creative writing, literature, neuroscience, lingusitics, law, and international politics.	I am currently an active member of Phocus, Vassar's photography/darkroom club, and a founding/executive board member of VassArt, Vassar's fine/public art club. On my own time, I enjoy digital and film photography (almost daily) as well as painting, drawing, design (2-d print media, digital, fashion, interior), reading novels/periodicals/poetry, writing poetry, journaling, taking apart mechanical watches, clocks, and cameras, building things out of cardboard, listening to music (all the time), watching cartoons, drinking tea, going for walks, and exploring wherever I happen to be.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	none	I grew up in a very secular household and feel uncomfortable saying prayers before meals.	No	nope	My primary concerns regarding housing, as mentioned, are being close to a metro station, being in a relatively safe neighborhood, and being able to cook and talk with whomever I am living with. From my prior experiences abroad and at home, I know that access to food and intellectual discourse are crucial to my well-being, and I'm sure would contribute to my linguistic and cultural education and development. As listed below, I have a variety of interests that could be taken into consideration, and while I do not in any way expect my host family to bring me on outings, I would love for them to at least talk with me about our interests/lives, and at best engage in these interests with me. I think this would help me to learn to talk about my interests in French, as well as to become more deeply involved and invested in the experience as a whole.  -  - I also think it is important to mention that while it is not a big part of my identity, I am very atheist and rather queer and thus probably would feel very uncomfortable in an extremely religiously/politically conservative household.			I don't really like small children or large dogs. As mentioned, I would LOVE to live with a host family in which there is at least someone who shares some interest with me--prioritized as follows: 1) photography 2) 2-d print media design 3) other kinds of design, including interior and fashion 4) other kinds of art 5) literature/philosophy. And of course, I want to cook with my host family. Other than that, I don't have any major concerns, although I do prefer a kind of casual environment regarding neatness (not dirty/gross, but also not obsessively tidy--i.e. I clean up after myself and expect others to do the same, but sometimes I don't make my bed). I work best in a quiet study space, but I'm also happy to go find a cafe or library somewhere to study if that's hard to find at home. I also have mild insomnia and try to stick to a pretty rigid 11pm-8am sleeping schedule during the week, and prefer it to be quiet/dark at night, although that's really best-case-scenario (it's definitely not possible in a dorm, or back home in California).
Dontsov	Olivia	Yes	Yes		I have travelled to France many times, but notably have lived in Rennes my junior year of high school with a host family, going to an American school taught by French teachers. During this time, I travelled to Paris, Nice, the Loire Valley, Quimper, Lille, and other places both on my own and with the school. My family also have friends in the South of France (in Lacoste), and I have probably spent altogether 2 months in Paris and 3 months in Lacoste in addition to my time in Rennes.	When living in Rennes, I had a host mother, Gisèle. She had two daughters who no longer lived with her, but would visit with their boyfriends sometimes. Gisèle and I had difficulty getting along for my first semester in France, but grew to be very close the second semester and was someone I got along with very well.	My mother and father don't live with each other, and I am an only child. I live with my mother (52) and her boyfriend (60): my mother is an elementary school teacher and her boyfriend is an artist and university professor. My father (49) is currently living in Kazakhstan, where he was born and raised, though he spends half his time in New York as well. He is an artist as well, and does graphic design work.	No	No	No	I can cook but I'm not proficient, and though I enjoy having time alone I do enjoy living with other people. I would ideally like to have a close relationship with my host family, where I would see and interact with them on a daily basis, rather than a relationship where I would use their home as boarding while I was in Paris.	Having lived in France before, I am familiar with the culture and how influential a study abroad experience can be. For me, my experience completely altered my thinking and helped me become a more compassionate person with a greater understanding of different culture and ways of life. One of my regrets about my abroad experience was that I spent a lot of time with American students, and I hope that I can become fully fluent in French and really immerse myself in the culture this time, taking as many classes at French university as possible, engaging with French students and with my host family.	I mainly am passionate about English and Creative Writing. I am currently taking Russian at Vassar alongside French (and am going to Saint-Petersburg after Paris), and so want to develop my Russian proficiency. I am also interested in the arts (theater, photography, dance), and many other humanities-based subjects (History, Women's Studies, etc.) and am curious about subjects such as Political Science and Religion.	I am on the executive board of two poetry organizations on campus, and spend some free time playing guitar, ukulele, and piano. I really enjoy reading and writing, as well as photography and dance.	Occasional smoker	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		No serious allergies.	N/A	No	No.	My primary concern is not establishing a close bond with my host family, and living with siblings. As an only child, I'm not used to living with children at all and I don't know how comfortable I would be with that kind of a living situation. My priority is mainly having my own space in the house, and having a host parent that isn't incredibly strict about the rules of living — however, I consider myself to be pretty accommodating when going out, inviting people over, and asking to use certain facilities (especially after having lived with a French host family before and having few problems in this regard). -  - I'm also concerned about being placed in a host family that is accepting of my sexuality and religious identity, as I know some students (on my previous program) who were placed in very religious families and felt uncomfortable.			I would prefer not to live with younger children or dogs, but have no problem with other kinds of animals, and while I am nervous about potentially having host siblings, I'm not averse to it. I am a very neat person, and make very little noise when at home. I usually study in my room at later hours of the night, and have a tendency to stay up to early hours of the morning. I usually don't have people over, and decorate my room sparsely.
Elahi	Niki	No	Yes	My grand-parents on my maternal side reside in Asnieres-sur-Seine and my grand-mother from my paternal side also lives in the same area. I would like to live at 3 Rue Trarieux, Asnieres-sur-Seine with my grand-parents.	I have traveled to France, particularly Paris, since early childhood at every opportunity such as winter break, spring break, and the majority of my summers. In addition, I have traveled to many countries in Europe during my summer vacations such as Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Luxembourg. Usually, my summer stays in Italy are for one month long, and when I stay in Paris, I could be there for around 2 months total each summer, excluding my trips during the year.	I have never had a home stay experience, but I have hosted a student from Denmark twice before. I met her through a tour she came on with her school at my high school, and after we bonded and exchanged information, the following year when she visited New York, my parents and I agreed to host her for one week. She loved the experience so much that she returned the following year alone and stayed with us for another week. The experience was transformative because I felt like I was making a difference in her international experience, and was contributing to her understanding and appreciation of New York. Beyond that, I found a true friend across the globe and have stayed in contact with her ever since. We shared many of our cultural experiences, and I have picked up on some Danish phrases, as she has picked up on some Farsi ones too!	My mother and father were both originally born in Iran. My father moved to Europe shortly after his high school education in Iran and has lived in Nice (he speaks fluent French) and Italy. He then moved to the states for higher education and attended Hoftra University for undergraduate studies and later went to Temple University for dental school. Similarly, my mother moved from Iran to Strasbourg, France for her high school years and picked up the French language fluently as well. She went to Hoftra University for her undergraduate studies as well, where she met my father, and later continued dental school at NYU. My brother is 3 years younger than I am and his name is Dani (Daniel officially). He currently goes to the same school I had gone to for my entire education, the Dwight School in NYC. He is currently in 11th grade. We have been extremely close since childhood and barely ever fight. He is like my best friend.  - As for culture, my maternal side is originally Kurdish so I have upheld that tradition by helping start a youth dance company based in NYC called the J-Hoon Musical Ensemble who had a show at Wesleyan in February. We believe in maintaining culture and tradition as well as being ethical and spiritual in our daily lives.	No	No	No	I have not lived independently before.	My principal reasons for coming to Paris are to further explore the city and to be able to fluently learn the language like my parents and the rest of my family. I want to be able to communicate eloquently and potentially find research opportunities in Paris or France in general. In addition, I want to immerse myself in the French culture like my parents have had the opportunity of doing so. Being in contact (in vivo!) with the culture and its people is crucial in understanding their traditions and values. I have always been fond of French people, and the city of Paris in general and hope to be able to grow my appreciation for Paris while staying there for a semester. Lastly, I have many family and friends who live there and I would love to be able to reconnect with them in a different manner, since I will actually be living there.	My academic interests are mostly science related, since I am double majoring in Neuroscience and Behavior (and French Studies). I love spending time learning about her human body as well as diseases and their preventions. Essentially, I am highly interested in global health and the function of NGO's and medical missions. I have traveled to Mongolia last May for a medical mission involving a team of 30 surgeons, medical students, residents, and nurses to offer free surgeries to people who needed urgent care.  -  - I also enjoy public speaking quite a lot, and will take any opportunity to do so. I participated in the Global Issues Network conference in Luxembourg for two consecutive years in high school, where making a presentation about sustainable development and world issues was the goal of the conference. I enjoy making presentations and speaking to large audiences.	Participating in the J-Hoon Musical Ensemble, as mentioned in a previous question, is my main leisure activity. It requires hours of practice on the weekends.We have performed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lincoln Center, and the Asia Society in New York. The goal of this group is to share and maintain the culture of the Kurdish people of Western Iran through joyous songs and dances. I am the dance director of the group, as well as the teacher for the younger generation of the group (3-6 year olds).  - i play the Daf (framed drum) which is a Kurdish, and generally middle eastern hand drum as well as the tanbour (ancient lute). I also play the piano and the flute.  -  - In addition, I love writing poetry on my own time, though I do not partake in this activity in order to be published. I find it very relaxing and cathartic. I sometimes write the poetry in English, and at other times, in Farsi.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	None.	None.	Yes	None.	I like my housing to be in a safe and quiet neighborhood. I like to have my own room and bathroom. Since my maternal grandparents, and my paternal grandmother all live in Paris, I would very much like to live with them. My paternal grandmother has just lost her husband of 53 years, my grandfather, and I would very much like to spend more of my free time with her.			If I am not placed to live with my grand parents and the only choice is to stay with a host family, I would not mind having older children (above age 6 or so). I would appreciate if the house is neat and in a nice/safe neighborhood. I usually sleep around midnight and would like the neighborhood to be relatively quiet, as well as the house itself. I need at least 8 hours of sleep each night to feel awake and fresh in the morning. I love dogs so it would be great to have one, though I am not a huge fan of cats (however, I wouldn't be opposed if the options come down to it).
Flournoy	Morgane	No	Yes		Yes, I have traveled to France with my immediate family and by myself almost every summer since I was born, to visit my maternal family in Paris and Nice. I am a dual Franco-American citizen.	No.	My parents are married, my father works in logistics, management, and transportation for CH Robinson, and my mother was a stay-at-home mom until I left for college, and now she works in translating. I have two younger sisters (18, 16) and a doggy who I love very much! I get along very well with my parents, and I am very close to my sisters.	No	Yes	No	I can cook for myself, although I am not very good at it. I am very good at living with other people, but I am sure I can be good at living by myself too.	I have always wanted to study abroad because I am majoring in International Studies and French and I would like to experience the world from a different perspective, not just from the classroom. I think it would open me to new points of view and help expand my knowledge as an International Studies and French double major.	Political science, geography, art history, french.	Varsity Women's Tennis DIII - Vassar Alliance of Women in Foreign Affairs - Sports Athletic Advisory Committee (SAAC) - Running Club - I also like to watch Netflix if I ever have free time, but I spend most of my time playing tennis and being active.	Occasional smoker	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	n/a	n/a		I am also allergic to cats so I cannot be in a home with cats, although I do love dogs.	I do not want to feel like I am intruding. I just want to be able to feel like their home is my home, and I want to feel comfortable to do things without feeling like I am overstepping boundaries. Mainly I would like to get along with my family.			I love love love children and I am really good with little kids. However, I think I would like to be in a home with people my own age so I can be friends with them and have them introduce me to their friends (theoretically), although I would not be opposed to being in a home with kids. I am very neat and tidy. I like to go to bed on the earlier side (11 pm) and if I can, I do prefer to sleep in, although I tend to wake up earlier (8/8:30 am) for class and working out and errands and whatnot. A little bit of noise is fine when I study, and I like to study in my room or at a kitchen table or something. I am honestly a very easy going roommate and do not consider myself very picky or high maintenance; I am clean, I have reasonable sleeping patterns, and I get along easily and well with others. I would like to get a close relationship with my host family though, and be able to do stuff with them, eat dinner with them, and feel like one of them. At the same time I do not want to feel stifled, and I would like to have my own space every once in a while.
Gampel	Daphne	Yes		I am hoping to live with my father and family instead of being placed with in a home-stay during my semester with the VWPP program in Paris. I have made this intention clear to the Wesleyan’s director of International studies. - Below is my father’s information : -  - 6 rue gobert, 11e arrondissement - 75011, Paris France  -  - Phone : +33 6 13 11 42 46	I have traveled to France around 10 times in my life. Each stay has lasted 20-3 weeks with the exception of the summer before my freshman year of college during which I spent a month in France. I have also traveled to Italy, India, Canada, for two week long periods. I also spent 7 weeks in Ecuador through a language emersion program.	I have never had a home stay experience with a foreign family or hosted an international student	My mothers family lives in New York and consists of my mother (51, psychiatrist), my step-dad (60, works for the Rockefeller-family-fund), step-sister (25, non-profit organizer), step-brother (20, student). My father’s family lives in Paris and consists of my father (52, professional pianist), my step-mother (50, city planner) and my two younger half-brothers (11 and 13).	No	Yes	Yes	In college I have a fairly independent living situation in that I live in a house, cook for myself, and take responsibility for my space. With this experience I hope to continue to live relatively independently while still living with my family. I will take responsibility for the upkeep of my and common spaces and I also plan to cook for myself often.	I primarily want to foster a deeper relationship with the city that I have fallen in love with over the course of the years I have spent visiting. This entails a greater comfort with language (both formal and vernacular), and a greater comfort with the city itself. I would also love the opportunity to spend a longer period of time living with my family in Paris. It is also my hope to return to Paris either for graduate school or for an early part of my career, and I would love to use this opportunity to develop a network during the VWPP program.	Music, European History, Psychology, Sociologie, and Anthropology	Because of my passion for music, a lot of my extra-curricular activities involve playing, practicing, listening to and writing music. Besides music, I enjoy seeing and experiencing other art (going to museums, seeing shows, etc). I also enjoy playing soccer, ultimate frisbee, and hiking.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			No		I am mostly concerned with finding a housing situation which can accommodate my playing and practicing music (frequently).			Although I love children and pets, I would prefer not to to be placed with a family with either if it is the case that I am not approved to live with my family. I am concerned that if i did I might be nervous about my instruments and other equipment being used. Otherwise I consider myself to be a pretty outgoing person and would appreciate living with other friendly and sociable people!
Jacono	Andrew	Yes	Yes		Yes -- I lived there for 5 weeks my junior summer of high school, and lived there for 6 weeks this past summer.	No.	My parents are divorced. My father is a plastic surgeon, my mom takes care of my siblings at home. I have 1 brother (11 years old) and 2 sisters (18 years old, will be attending The University of Wisconsin Madison in the Fall, and 7 years old, half-sister)	Yes	No	No	I lived in a hotel in Paris for 6 weeks last summer. While initially jarring, it turned out positively. That said, I would much rather live with a family because of the inherent comfort of convivial living and because it will improve my language ability immensely.	I love Paris and its people, and coming to Paris again would further expand my view of the French world. I plan to improve my French fluency and also plan to meet a wide range of people with different experiences and worldviews that can influence my own.	I love writing of all forms, and I love all forms of literature. I also love philosophy and psychology, as they provide great insight into interpersonal interaction. I also love history, and dabble in the sciences, but the humanities are my favorite.	I am an avid hiker and mountaineer. I am very interested in writing and reading for leisure. I love to play guitar and incorporate music into my daily life. In general, I am open to nay new experience that will present new insights.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None	None	No	I am severely allergic to cats, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, and any other household pet that sheds, even if they are hypoallergenic. I will get asthma attacks and thus cannot live in such a residence. I am also allergic to mold and dust.	My health; I am allergic to dogs, cats, and other household animals that shed or disperse dander. I also want to be placed in a family household.			I would love to be in a family with children, as children are open to conversation regardless of one's language capabilities. I would like a host family interested in literature and music and having fun. I require quiet to study, although this can be a rather unpredictable matter. I would like for the accommodations to be relatively tidy, though I am not too picky. I usually go to bed at 12:00-1:00 am, which is something the family should know.
Kerner	Valerie	Yes	Yes		I traveled to Paris five years ago and stayed for approximately five days.	No	My parents are married and I live with them and my younger sister who is 17. My father is a wood-floor sander and my mother works for New York State. My sister is a high school student and is going to college next year. I also have two dogs.	No	Yes	No	I think my experience from living with two other roommates in one small room and sharing a dormitory bathroom made it so that I'd be able to survive in almost any living situation.	My principal reasons are to improve my French language skills, become more fluent speaking in French, and learn more about different aspects of French culture.	My main academic interests are politics, history, economics, French, German, and music.	I'm a classically trained pianist, I enjoy going to see live music, I like visiting all kinds of museums, outdoor activities, and going out to eat.	No	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Severe Tree-Nut and Peanut allergy - I'm lactose intolerant so I do not eat much dairy		Yes	I'm allergic to cats and dogs, but I'm being treated for both so it's not a major concern (I like cats and dogs and own them) but I am allergic. I'm also allergic to dust and mold (being treated for those too) but living in a dirty/dusty space makes me very ill.	My biggest concern is living somewhere that accommodates my allergies and health concerns so that I'm not ill.			I'd love it if there was a piano in available for me to practice. I'm also a very neat and clean person. I don't mind children or animals. I'm a night owl.
Moraru	Mia	No	Yes		I lived in Romania when I was young for about three years with my grandparents and extended family, while my parents were in the US. I have traveled to many European countries throughout my life.	No.	I live with my parents and my younger brother. My mom works in architectural ornament and teaches some architecture courses. My dad was a surgeon in Romania, and now in the US he works as a researcher in cellular and molecular biology, as well as a professor for some medical school courses. My brother is 17 years old, and he is in grade 11 at our public high school. When I was younger my brother and I shared a room, until I was 10.	No	No	No		I love traveling and am very interested in other cultures, so I am really looking forward to fully immersing myself in French culture and life. Living in a place for so long is very different from just visiting like a tourist, so I am very excited about having Paris become a small home for me - to know its quirks, to find its interesting secluded spots, and to meet French people. I also really want to be fluent in French; that is one of my main goals. I'm an art history major, and Paris is a very special place for art and art history that I want to explore. I am also pre-med and am hoping to be a surgeon, but I want to work with relief organizations like Médecins Sans Frontières, so learning French and living in France would help tremendously.	I am an art history major and am also pre-med, so I love art and the sciences. I also (both fortunately and unfortunately) am interested in practically every subject. Everything fascinates me and I just love learning. I am interested especially in philosophy, sociology, languages, history, literature and maths.	I have been dancing for 13 years, and am a part of Vassar's dance company. I am a part of an acapella group and have sung in choirs. I did gymnastics and diving until recently. I take harp lessons at Vassar and really enjoy playing instruments. I love to paint and draw in my free time, and I love reading - these and being outdoors are some of my all-time favorite things to do. I am a part of activist groups on campus. I am a diver, and was on the swim & dive team my first year at Vassar. In general, I really like adventuring, such as urban exploration and climbing things. I love hiking and being outdoors, and have done multiple camping trips with both friends and family.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No allergies, but I am not a big seafood eater. I am always willing to try anything, but in general I find that I don't like a lot of the seafood that I’ve tried.	None.	No	No.	I don't have any major concerns. I just would love to be able to live with hosts that have children if it's possible!			I would love to be able to be in a home that also has other children! I like animals, especially cats, so living with pets would be alright for me. With regards to smoking - I can live with smokers but only if the smoking is not in the whole house or if it is not right near my room.
Rosa	Dalen	Yes	Yes		I have traveled to France and Paris at least six times. I have only spent at most two weeks there.  I lived in Rabat, Morocco one summer for a month and I lived in Punta Gorda, Belize three weeks last summer.	When I stayed in Morocco, I stayed with a family for two weeks. I had a very positive experience with this family and learned a lot about the culture and the languages of Morocco. This experience makes me excited to live with another family abroad.	I live with my parents and my grandmother. My two brothers were twenty when I was born, so I grew up as an only child.	Yes	Yes	Yes	This experience was positive living with some friends for a week one summer, so I am open to living in the same arrangement.	I think it is a wonderful city that I have always wanted t study in since I started learning the language.	My main academic interests are biology and French. I really hope to continue my course of study of biology while I am in France as well as improving my French language skills.	I would like to continue working out and possible playing tennis as I am on the club tennis team at Wesleyan.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Any type of pepper makes me throw up		No	No	I am open to living with roommates, but I would prefer to have a single room in any of the living situations either host family or dorming.			I prefer during week days for people to be quiet at night, but on the weekend people should be able to be loud and play music.
Ruparell	Shiv				Calgary Canada (16yrs); London UK (7yrs); Ecuador (3months); France (1month backpacking); weeks/months in India; China; Japan; Argentina; Chile; Brazil; Mexico; Costa Rica; Caribbean; South Africa; Botswana; UAE, et al.	To some extent, I have had homestay experiences with a foreign family, but not in a traditional exchange. As I am an international student at Vassar, I consider my entire time in the U.S. to be a homestay (the “Vassar family”). I have also spent time living with extended family in India, and split my time growing up between Canada and the UK. In Calgary, our family also hosted 3 international students from Chandigarh who were visiting for a speech and debate competition. I thoroughly enjoyed having international students stay with my family, though I will admit that after a couple of days I began to feel a bit claustrophobic – I’m the kind of person who is outgoing and friendly, but who also needs space from others at the end of each day. When I travel or stay with family abroad outside of the USA, Canada, or the UK, I value my time there for a couple of weeks, but ultimately end up craving my own home comforts and independence. In Paris, I look forward to living with a non-relative foreign family with a cultural background far different than my own. I am easy to get along with, and will go out of my way with my homestay family to be respectful and as least disruptive as possible. I look forward to, hopefully, becoming a “part of the family” while also accelerating my conversational French language skills.	My father (54) is the CEO and President of AVR Enterprises, a diversified investment and holding corporation with interest in automotive, hospitality (hotels), oil and gas, and real estate development. Formerly, he was a lawyer practicing corporate, real estate, and securities law. He did his Bachelor of Commerce at the University of Calgary, and his JD at the University of Toronto. My mother (51) recently began working at a boutique women’s clothing store in Calgary started by her friends and herself (my mother is my fashion icon). She completed her post-secondary education at a college in London. My brother Anshul (26) is currently finishing his MBA at Columbia University, and after graduating will work with FJ Labs, an angel venture capital firm (AVC). Before Columbia, he was in investment banking and private equity. My other brother Amar (24) works in real estate development as an associate for CBRE. Anshul is a travel and fitness enthusiast, and he did his undergraduate at the University of Western Ontario in commerce. Amar is a basketball fanatic and did his undergraduate at Wilfred Laurier University in political science. My soon-to-be sister in law, Georgia (27), was formerly a lawyer with Blakes and is now General Counsel and Business Advisor for OneFineStay. My family and I are very close – my brothers are my best friends, and we talk on the phone daily. I also have close relationships with both of my parents.	Yes	No	Yes	Yes – last summer, I Interned at the Canadian Embassy to the United States in Washington, D.C. I lived by myself in an apartment in Adams Morgan, in the north part of the city. I definitely enjoyed living alone, as I am a social person who also likes to come home and quietly unwind during personal downtime. I also lived independently with friends during an academic biology research trip in Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands.  -  - In my view, one of the best parts of the VWPP program is the chance to stay with a Parisian family – learning the language and culture in a home setting, making new friends and new family, and appreciating a different way of life. Having said that, I have spent extensive time abroad as well as extensive time living independently, experiences that have fostered my independence and made me both happy and comfortable living without heavy reliance on family or friends. Because of these experiences, I would like a housing situation in Paris where I could both interact with a friendly family often, while also being able to live an independent lifestyle without restrictions from my host family. What I want to convey is that I am a friendly, outgoing-people person who can’t wait to join a new family, but who has also spent a fair bit of time living alone and abroad and would like some degree of independence from my host family.	To become fluent in French. As a Western Canadian, my French language skills prior to Vassar were very rudimentary. However, because I want to pursue a career in foreign service with the Government of Canada, fluency in French is a necessity. This is my primary motivation for coming to Paris. I also love Paris, and have thoroughly enjoyed my stays there; the food, the architecture, the nightlife, and the proximity in Europe, were all factors in my choosing Paris. Furthermore, I know that the VWPP program is exceptional, and that I will appreciate the support of Reid Hall during my stay.	I am and International Studies and Economics double-major with a Correlate Sequence (minor) in French and Francophone Studies. Within these fields, I focus primarily on international relations from a political-science approach as well as developmental economics. Some of my favourite classes at Vassar have included “Ending Deadly Conflict,” “Development Economics,” “Urban Economics,” “Political Transitions in Europe,” “Global Political Economy,” etc. I also have enjoyed courses such as Religions in Asia and Sociology, as well as Biology.	In terms of extra-curriculars, I am heavily involved in Model UN, debate, and student government. I am also on the Varsity Squash Team, am the president of the Vassar Hindu Association, and am a stylist and editor for the College Catalogue, an online fashion blog run by Vassar students using Vassar student-models and fashion. For leisure, I am enthusiastic about fitness; I go to the gym often, and thoroughly enjoy hiking and being in the outdoors. I am also an avid and frequent skier, having grown up near the Rocky Mountains. I am a social person who likes to hangout with friends often. I am also a nightlife person, often going out to clubs and bars with my friends in the evenings. Despite being outdoorsy, I love spending my Sundays watching my favourite shows on Netflix.	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	N/A	Can't eat beef.	Yes	I have seasonal and grass allergies, and am also allergic to many types of mould. As such, living in a very old building might be problematic allergy-wise in terms of the mould. I’m not allergic to cats or dogs, but I do get a bit scared of large or loud dogs.	My concern is being hosted with a family accepting of my various identities; as a queer student of colour, who is also non-Christian (Hindu), I hope that I can be housed with someone who is, at least in personal interactions with me, tolerant. My priority is being in a central area of Paris where I can go out in the evening or go shopping/sight-seeing during the day within walking distance, while also being within a 25-minute metro ride of my Sorbonne-campus. Location is key for me.			I am a pretty neat and tidy person. I would prefer to not live with children, but it’s not a deal-breaker, I’m not bad with kids. I study during the evening at coffee shops or at home, and often with friends. Weekdays I sleep by midnight and wakeup at 9, weekends I sleep by 1-2:30am and wakeup by noon. I can be quiet if I need to, but I definitely like singing in the shower from time to time. I’m interested in all types of music, TV shows and movies, skiing, dancing, fashion, and of course politics (I am an avid follower of the French election). I’m easy to get along with and can’t wait to get started!
Schatz	Claudia	Yes	Yes		I have never lived in a foreign country, and I have only traveled abroad twice. The summer that I was 16, I spent two weeks in England with a friend and her family: one week in London and one week in a small village in the north called Dent. I traveled again to England during my spring break in 2017, traveling with two friends to visit to visit our other friend who was studying abroad at the University of Nottingham. We spent four days in Nottingham and four days in London.	No experience.	I grew up and live with my mom, dad, and older sister. My father is a scientific researcher and Chair of the Immunology department at Yale Medical School. My mom does not currently work, but she has been a teacher, admissions officer, freelance editor, and high school volunteer. My sister is 22, three years older than I am, and lives in Athens, Georgia, where she is a research technician at the University of Georgia's Odum School of Ecology. I am close with my family, but especially with my parents.	No	Yes	No	I have only ever lived at home with my family, or here at Wesleyan in dorm-style housing. My freshman year, I lived in a triple with two other girls, so I know that I am able to share space but I am also aware of the frustrations that come with it. This year, I have a single but live near other friends. My experiences have made me realize that I love having my own room and my own space, but that living with other people is important to me. I like to interact with others, especially at the end of the day. Having a family kitchen and bathroom easily accessible makes a space feel like home. I have learned that I can be flexible living with other people, but also that I am very sensitive to noise and have trouble sleeping in loud environments.	I want to get better at speaking French. I have always hoped to gain proficiency in another language and be able to use it in conversation and writing. Fluency may be a long shot, but I definitely want to be stretched, pushed, and forced to use my French all the time. I know this will be uncomfortable but I really look forward to growing as a speaker and writer. I am interested in language itself, and am an avid reader and writer of English. I focus more on my French than any other subject because it feels like I am learning to use a new tool, one that is directly applicable to real life and literally opens up the world to me. I love the feeling of making tangible progress, and I want to continue. -  - I am also excited to go to France to experience another part of the world, which includes so much food, art, and architecture. As an Art History major, I look forward to seeing art firsthand and studying it in class. I have never lived outside of the US, but on the brief trips I have taken to England, I am struck by how the feeling of a foreign place is so different from home, even when it is another Western, English-speaking country. I have also never lived in a large city, so spending time in Paris will be new to me. I want to explore the city, as well as other parts of France and beyond. Living in France is a great starting place to travel to other European countries. -  - I also think that leaving Wesleyan, Connecticut, and America is important for me. I grew up in New Haven and go to college just 45 minutes from home. While I love being close, I also think it will be good for me to be far away from everything I know. Learning to live with distance from my family and friends and my identity here will allow me to explore and grow. Throughout my sophomore year, I sometimes struggled with feeling trapped, static, and worn out. I am ready to be refreshed and challenged by being so far away.	Creative writing - I love to write, especially short stories. I attended a public arts high school where I "majored" in creative writing, and at Wesleyan I have taken several writing classes and wrote a student published book of short stories. I consider writing a huge part of my identity. -  - Art History - I'm an art history major. I am exploring this subject still, and don't yet know what area of art history interests me most, but I love learning the stories behind a work of art and the effects of the artist's techniques. -  - French - I'm a French studies major. I have been taking French since 7th grade (age 12), with the exceptions of my freshman year of high school and my freshman year of college. I missed it when I didn't take it, and decided to dive back in my sophomore year. Though I started out the year feeling like I was behind my peers, I have made enough progress that I feel more confident now.	Running - I am on the varsity Track and Field and Cross Country teams. This is a huge commitment, and I love it. I run or work out every single day, and compete once a week for all three seasons of the year. I would love to have access to parks or good places to do long runs (up to 8 miles). I also need to use an elliptical machine once or twice a week. I have a history of injury, so most days I have to do some stretching and strengthening exercises to prevent recurring problems.  -  - Reading/writing - my favorite things to do in both French and English! -  - Piano - I play and practice recreationally but don’t perform. -  - Dance - I am in Terpsichore, Wesleyan's all-inclusive dance show for dancers with any level of experience, but I am not experienced! It's just very relaxing and has built my confidence. -  - I also love to sing, listen to music, do crossword puzzles, hike, swim, play board games, watch movies, play Frisbee, and cook breakfast foods.			No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	None.	None.	No	None.	My principal concern is comfort and language learning with my host family. I know My principal concern is comfort and language learning with my host family. I know that I am not as experienced with French as many VWPP students, and I am worried about this. I feel quite shy when I first meet people, even when we are speaking English, and I am not very experienced with spoken French, so I expect my shyness will be even stronger when I first arrive in Paris. I am quiet and somewhat nervous in general, but I am prepared for this and planning to be enthusiastic and friendly even if I am uncomfortable. However, I know that when I am around talkative, warm people with a good sense of humor, I come out of my shell and am able to thrive. I would be incredibly thankful if my host family were patient and kind as I continue to learn French. I would love if they were able to help me speak better and with fewer errors, and if they could both help me practice and also correct my mistakes. It is a priority for me that my family is a language resource who I can ask for help without feeling embarrassed. Having a close, supportive relationship with my host family is my priority because I tend to shut down socially when I am very nervous, and speaking French can be intimidating.  -  - I think I can be resilient and flexible in different home environments, and I do not require a lot of space or anything fancy (though easy access to public transport is important). I am neat, quiet, organized, and was raised doing household chores, so I think I can be a helpful and respectful part of a family. Overall, my relative lack of experience speaking French in addition to my shyness means that a welcoming, non-judgmental, and educational home environment/host family is a priority for me.			I am sensitive to noise. I have a hard time sleeping/studying through sounds of music, television, or voices. I can sleep through the sound of traffic, however. - I love animals and pets! - I sleep from between 12am or 1am to 8am or 9am but am flexible (I can go to sleep and wake up earlier) - I eat a lot of food and am often hungry, partly because I exercise every day. - I am neat, organized, and like to live in a clean environment. - I have experience with being around others after they're asleep or before they're awake, so I can be quiet. - I like to have some time to myself every day. - I am very studious and spend a lot of time on my schoolwork, or reading and writing.
Schein	Alexandra	Yes	Yes		This past summer I spent three weeks in Europe. One week in London with my friends family at their home, one week in Paris with my friends grandparents in their home, and one week in Barcelona in a hostel. I also spent three weeks in Costa Rica on a trip with my camp.	No	My parents are divorced and have been since I was young. They don't speak much. I live with my mom, sister, my mom's boyfriend and his daughter in Manhattan. My dad lives in New Jersey 15 minutes away and I see him on weekends. I'm close to both my parents. My sister is 22 and she is my best friend.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I'm nervous to live with a host family because it will be very new for me and I don't want to be a burden to the family. I try my best to be a good house guest whenever I'm at anyone's home and especially when a family will be taking me into their home. I think I will be self-sufficient in the household, but it will take me time to get to know where everything is and I won't want to overstep my boundaries at all so I would be cautious of how I take care of myself in the home.	I have a strong passion for traveling. I have not traveled a lot in my life though it has always been a huge desire of mine. After I went to Paris over the summer, I knew I wanted a deeper experience. I love the culture and the city is beautiful. I started taking the language in high school because I found it beautiful, as well. I also hope to travel around Europe during my stay.	Film, Computer Science	I like watching movies and television in my free time. I love crosswords and I play guitar, but I probably wont bring my guitar to Paris.	Occasional smoker	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			No		I worry about the fundamental cultural differences between Americans and Parisians and how this will affect my relationship with my host. I intend to immerse myself in French culture as much as possible, but I worry about this initial barrier.			I hope my host(s) are open minded and friendly. I am nervous to go to Paris not knowing many people, nor the culture, and I will struggle with a language barrier at first since I don't consider myself completely fluent so a supportive host would be nice. I love animals and would love to be placed in a home with one. I wouldn't mind living with kids, but it would intimidate me a bit to be placed with children because I would worry that they would feel that I am imposing on their home.
Schultz	Elena	Yes	Yes		I spent two and a half weeks in France as an exchange student during high school. Two weeks were spent with a host family in Épinal, and a half week was spent in Paris with the people on my program.	Yes, the above experience was a home stay, and the next summer I hosted the French student that I had stayed with in my own hometown for two weeks. It was a wonderful experience, and her family was very similar to my own in that they liked gardening and buying natural foods, they valued family time by having meals together and cooking together, and they prioritized travel, so we would often take small trips outside of Épinal together. In terms of how this experience influences my current preferences for housing, I enjoyed how engaged they were in my stay (although I understand this is more common for high school home stays). I also enjoyed living with my host sister who was my age and was able to show me around the city, as well as my younger host brother—I really like kids, and he was fun to practice my French with. My host parents were also really kind people who took good care of me, and they reminded me of my own parents, which made me feel immediately more comfortable while in a new country.	I’m very close to my family, which consists of my mom, dad, and younger brother. My mom works part-time as a social worker, and my dad works as an audiologist (a doctor specializing in hearing). They’re both very warm and loving people, and as a family we like to go hiking, biking, and camping together. We also all like to read and cook together. My younger brother is 17, a junior in high school, and he runs track and cross country. We also have a dog who we like to take for walks together.	No	Yes	No	I’ve only lived in dormitory-style housing at Vassar (which is typical for sophomores), but did live with roommates my freshman year and thought that was a wonderful experience—my two roommates ended up becoming two of my best friends here at school. I wouldn’t mind doing it again! I intend to live in a house over the summer with roommates and cook for myself, which is something I enjoy and do at home, although I especially enjoy cooking with other people. Although I’m certain I’ll be eager to eat food cooked by Parisians, I’d also look forward to making my own meals while in Paris.	Apart from my academic motivations from coming to Paris, which I’ll explain in the next question, I’m primarily looking forward to studying abroad as a way to improve my communication skills in French, more deeply appreciate the culture through immersion, and challenge my America-centric belief system by engaging with new people.	I am an English major and French correlate, and I hope to change that to an English/French double major after I study abroad in Paris. My main academic interests are focused on literature, poetry, translation, women’s studies, and humanities-based science (like the STS program at Vassar), and I hope to approach all of these topics through both English and French lenses. I find value in studying French in Paris in order to understand the country’s literature and writing more authentically and look forward to studying English and French literature comparatively once I understand French better. I also hope to go to graduate school for English literature, and as graduate students in literature are expected to supplement their studies with those in other languages, this is an excellent opportunity to prepare for more school after Vassar.	In my free time, I work as a senior editor at the Miscellany News (the Vassar weekly newspaper), an editorial intern at the Vassar Quarterly (the campus alumnae/I magazine), and an editorial board member at the Vassar Critical Journal (the English Department journal). I also play the clarinet in a chamber group on campus, dance in a non-auditioned dance group called Vass Shakers, and work as a Student Fellow (like an R.A.) in Main Building as a mentor to first-year students. Outside of my extracurriculars, I like to be outside, read, paint, draw, and write.	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	N/A	N/A	Yes	Allergic to cats	I'd like to avoid being hosted by a single man, would like wifi if possible to be able to skype home, would like to be able to practice French with my host family, and would also prefer a more liberal family if possible.			I would enjoy living with younger children and dogs! I tend to enjoy neater spaces but will be fine as long as I have my own room for doing work. If possible, it would be nice to live in an artsier neighborhood or a neighborhood oriented towards younger people, because I'd like to feel a part of the community I'm living in for the semester. Being with a family who is okay with cooking vegetarian food when possible would be really helpful too!
Shea	Elise				I've traveled to France three times. First I did a short exchange program (2 weeks) when I was 11 years old with a French student living in Marseille. Then in 2013 and 2014 I attended the Paris Opera Ballet School's summer program. This lasted 2 weeks both years.	I had a wonderful host experience when I lived with my exchange student's family in Marseille. Her family took great care of me and I got along well with her parents, grandmother, and siblings who all lived there. Based on this experience I would be comfortable living with a family.	Both of my parents are doctors and they're in their early 50s. I have a younger brother who is 16 and a large dog.	Yes	Yes	Yes	I took a gap year and danced professionally with a ballet company. During that I year, I lived in an apartment with two other people I worked with. I cooked for myself every day, paid my bills, cleaned the apartment, etc. Based on this experience, I am very comfortable with living with a host family. I see myself as a very independent person.	My principal reason for coming to Paris is to become fluent in French. I'm also very active within Vassar's organization called Vassar Refugee Solidarity, so I hope to learn about the refugee situation in France and become very involved with an organization working with refugees in Paris.	I'm in International Studies major with concentrations in Political Science and Economics. While in Paris I would like to learn about the European Union and European politics. I would also like to take a class on Middle Eastern Studies or perhaps a class on xenophobia in Europe.	I have danced since I was four years old, so being able to take ballet and contemporary dance classes in Paris is very important to me. I also love yoga, pilates, and going to the gym. I love hiking and biking, traveling, going to museums, trying new food and restaurants, seeing shows/performances, and going to concerts. I also love to cook and bake.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		I like to eat very healthy and I rarely eat red meat or pork. I'm not a picky eater though, and I'm happy to try new food!	Yes	I'm allergic to cats and I have asthma, so I really cannot live with a family that smokes.	I would prefer to not live with babies, but I'm fine living with older children or teenagers. I would prefer to not live with another host student. Since I'm allergic to cats and since I have asthma, I cannot live with cats or with people who smoke.			I would love to live with a dog. I'm a very neat person, so it would like to live with a family that is tidy. I tend to go to bed around midnight and wake up around 7:00am-8:00am. I don't consider myself a noisy person, so I would prefer if the family isn't very noisy (i.e. have small children). Of course, I would love it if my family was interested in the arts or any other hobbies that I listed above.
Stier	Severine	Yes	Yes	N/a	I visited a friend in France for two weeks before my senior year of high school. I stayed at host family’s house in Grenoble and traveled with them to Saint Tropez and Paris.	My two-week homestay in France was a major learning and growing experience for me. Not only was I presented with a new culture and way of life, but I was introduced into a unique family dynamic. I was impressed at how important quality family-time was to my family – for instance, every member was required to be present for dinner, which was a central part of their day. I absolutely loved meal-time with my host family as it enabled me to talk to each family member at length and practice my French. I would prefer if my host family in Paris has a desire to integrate me in familial activities, meals, and outings. Just as I was eager to learn from my host family, they expressed a deep interest in learning about myself and American culture. I hope this is the same during my time in Paris.	I am lucky to say that I am a member of a close-knit family. My dad is a lawyer, my mother is a psychologist, and my sister (age 17) is currently a junior in high school. My relationship with my family is the most important facet of my life. I firmly believe that I am my “best” self when I am with others who support me, and my family provides me with everything I need to feel confident and loved. I go to my mother for advice about personal problems and to my father for assistance with my academics.	No	No	No	Since I have never lived in an independent living situation before (only a dormitory style of living in college), I'd like it if my host family expresses a willingness to integrate me into the dynamics within the household. I would like to become more independent throughout my time in Paris and develop more trust surrounding my own actions and ideas, but hope that my family supports me along the way.	I have dreamed of studying in Paris ever since I was young. I am so excited to immerse myself in an intellectually stimulating and immersive setting, improve my written and spoken French, and learn about a new culture and way of life that are fairly foreign to me. I hope to build strong relationships with my host family and the native French speakers I encounter that can last a lifetime. I am also excited to meet students from different liberal arts colleges who are my age and challenge myself as I get to know them in a new place.	I am an English major and Francophone Studies minor at Davidson College. I have become particularly fascinated with the history, construction, and evolution of stories, especially now as we enter a rapidly evolving digital climate. This has compelled me to take various Digital Studies classes here at Davidson. I am also interested in French cinema, literature, and politics. As for my future profession, I am interested in publishing, advertising and marketing, and the non-profit sector.	I love to spend time alone reading, journaling, or meditating. Personal space and time to reflect is very important to me. As for physical activity, I like running, biking, and hiking. I also enjoy exploring, going on adventures with my friends and family, and serving the community in any way I can. I love trying new food, listening to music, and try to watch at least one movie a week.	No	No	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No specific dietary allergies, but I get incredibly nauseous when I eat buttery or creamy dishes. I like most cheeses except American and Cheddar.	N/a	No	Allergic to all penicillins.	I would like it if I am paired with a host family that does not smoke inside the household. I grew up with an aunt who smoked and being in a household that smells like smoke reminds me of her addiction. I also hope that my family is hospitable and respectful of my needs.			I like going to bed early and am a light sleeper, so I prefer when my surroundings are as quiet as possible. I do not love animals, but I do not mind the presence of a dog or a cat. Cleanliness and neatness are very important to me, so I’d hope that my family takes these aspects seriously or makes a concerted effort to keep the house clean and tidy. Since I adore being around other people, I would like to have a host family with kids who I can speak to and spend time with. I truly want my homestay to be a place I look forward to coming home to after a long day. I hope my host family and I can cultivate strong and lasting relationships.
Swaminathan	Medha	Yes	Yes		I have traveled to London, Paris, and Playa del Carmen for a week or less and have been to India (Chennai, Kolkata) for up to a month. I have never lived for more than a few weeks in a foreign country.	No.	I am an only child and I live with my mother (a dance teacher, who works from home), my father (a lawyer with the federal government) and my dog. My aunt, uncle, and two cousins frequently visit us and stay for weekends or longer (almost every other weekend).	No	Yes	Yes	While I have not lived outside of a dorm while at Wesleyan, I have lived with a roommate and at home, I cook all my meals myself. I love to cook and I have a food blog (Whisk & Shout). As such, when it comes to taking care of myself, I am very independent and rather low-maintenance. If I had the option, I would love to live somewhere where I would be able to cook a few meals a week!	I am excited to engage with and participate in the culture that I have been studying for the past nine or so years, and as part of my French Studies major, I am required to go abroad. Not only am I looking forward to living in another country, particularly France, but I am also hoping to do some research and/or begin to think about my thesis. I also hope to make connections in Paris and other parts of France, so that I may continue to maintain my connection to France and French Studies beyond my study abroad and college experiences.	I am a psychology and French double major and I hope to attend law school. As a liberal arts student, my academic interests are diverse, but I am particularly interested in social theory and the criminal justice system as an avenue of research in the future. The ways in which social activism (awareness of intersections of race, gender, class, etc. & environmental justice) intersect with human behavior and cultural history are of great interest to me.	Beyond my classes, on campus, I develop my varied interests as a peer sustainability advisor to freshmen (an Eco Facilitator), a member of the Wesleyan Green Fund Committee, a lab assistant in a cognitive psychology lab, a board member of Shakti (Wesleyan's South Asian Student Coalition), and as a dancer and choreographer with Fusion, WesMalai, and WESBurlesque. In my free time, I go to the gym five times a week and work on my food blog, Whisk & Shout.	No	No	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	No allergies, but as said earlier, my body cannot process meat or fish.	N/A	Yes	Slightly allergic to cats, but it's not a big deal.	My number one priority is being able to eat a vegetarian diet. I have never ingested meat (includes fish), and as such, any amount of meat will make me ill. However, I am prepared to cook for myself, to eat a more limited range of foods than I may find at home/at Wesleyan, and to dine at restaurants.			
Takil	Ilayda	Yes	Yes		I traveled to Paris, France for one week. (2014)	No.	I have a younger brother who is 15 years old.  - My parents are divorced, and each are 49 years old. My father is a bond salesman and my mother is a personal fitness trainer.	No	No	No	---	I will study in Paris because this experience will be pertinent to my current studies. I am an International Studies major (concentrating in French and Political Science). I want to be immersed in French culture to have a better understanding of the country. This experience will thus be particularly useful when I write my senior thesis on a topic related to French politics/society. I also aim to improve my fluency in French, so studying in Paris while living with a French family will certainly help me achieve this goal.	My main academic interests lie in the humanities, particularly international relations, political science, and French studies. I am also interested in art history.	I play tennis and I enjoy hiking and biking. I also enjoy the arts, such as going to museums and painting/drawing. I like to read for leisure.	No	No		Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	none	none	No	No	My principal priority is for my housing to be located in the center of Paris.
