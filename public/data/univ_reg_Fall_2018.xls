Ahuja	Siddhant	Economics		French Studies		3rd	2nd	1st	5th	Since I achieved a B2 in the TCF, I feel I am proficient enough to take a class at Paris 7. It is also my first preference because they offer a wide range of economics classes that I am interested in, especially: Économie de l'enterprise and Migrations et Mondialisations. Paris 4 also offers a variety of economics classes, and it is also my second choice simply because of its optimal location. Most importantly, since Diderot (7) is best for the social sciences, I am leaning towards it the strongest.			4th	Paris 7	IB Diploma Programme (NSS Hill Spring International School - 2016)	2016	India	Mumbai		Sophomore	Reda Moursli - (Wesleyan University Economics) and Michael Meere (Wesleyan University French)	2016	Economics and French 	Economics and French 	Non					
Azuelos	Alexander	Earth Science and Society				3rd	2nd	1st	5th	My main academic interests include Earth Science, Geography, Geopolitics, and Environmental Studies. Paris 7 seems to have the most offerings of courses within this field, while Paris 4 also has some Geography and Land Use classes.			4th	Paris 7	High School Diploma	2016	United States	Abington	Pennsylvania	Junior	Earth Science and Geography	2016	Earth Science and Society	Earth Science	Non					
Beech	Caroline	Cognitive Science		Mathematics		4th	5th	1st	3rd	Ideally, in order to continue to make progress towards my Math major, I would like to take at least one math class during my semester abroad. In particular, I would be interested in taking a course in mathematical logic, since I will be away when Mathematical Logic is offered at Vassar. I am also very interested in taking a linguistics class. This class could count towards the Language and Communication elective path that I have chosen for my major in Cognitive Science. Taking a linguistic class in Paris would also be advantageous since Vassar does not offer very many linguistics classes, and since I would be able to experience a unique perspective from the English-influenced approach I have seen so far. Given these goals, my first choice of university is Paris 7. If it is not possible for me to take classes at Paris 7, I think Paris 12 represents my next best option.			2nd	Paris 7	High school diploma	2016	United States	New Haven	Connecticut	Junior	Sciences cognitives et Mathématiques	2016	Sciences cognitives et Mathématiques	Mathématiques	Non					
Chester	Cormac	English		Philosophy		3rd	1st	5th	4th	If possible, I need to take three philosophy classes (or three classes that will count towards the philosophy major). As far as I'm aware, Paris 4 definitely and Paris 12 likely have philosophy classes. I haven't been able to find philosophy classes at Paris 3 or Paris 7 (although I could be wrong), and I imagine that my French is not at the level required for CIPh.			2nd	Paris 4	Diplôme	2016	United States	Kansas City	Missouri	Junior	Philosophie et Anglais à université Wesleyan	2016	Philosophie, Anglais	Licence Philosophie	Non					
Clejan	Thomas					2nd	4th	1st		I am a Computer Science and Economics double major, and I think that these rankings would suit these majors best.

Cole	Elizabeth (Betsy)	History		French		3rd	2nd	4th	5th	I am majoring in History and French so it doesn't make sense for me to go to Paris 7 or CIPh. I chose Paris 12 as my first choice because Clementine made it seem the most like Wesleyan in terms of not having an excessively competitive environment and she said the administration is very welcoming to international students which I think will make adjusting to a French University very easy. I am also very interested in art history and would like to take an art history class so I put Paris 4 as my second choice.			1st	Paris 12	High School Diploma	2016	United States	Portsmouth 	New Hampshire	Junior	History Department and French Department  	2016	History and French 	French 	Non					
Compton	Nell					2nd	3rd	1st		I'm interested in political science, and need to take a course poli sci credit for my major, so I'm hoping to be able to take that at Paris 7. There's a chance that my TCF score might not be high enough for placement in Paris 7, or also that I'd be able to get poli sci credit from one of the VWPP courses, in which case I'd like to take some sort of history or sociology class at Paris 3 or Paris 4.

DeNooyer	Allegra	Urban Studies		French and Francophone Studies		3rd	4th	1st	5th	My first choice is Paris 7, because I am an Urban Studies major with concentrations in Political Science and Geography, so I'm interested in taking courses in geography, history, or sociology, all of which are offered at Paris 7. In particular, I would like to take a course having to do with political science, probably in the history department, and a course about urban studies, probably in the geography or sociology department. My second choice is Paris 12, because it also offers history, geography, sociology, and political science courses.			2nd	Paris 7	High school diploma	2016	United States	Milton	Massachusetts	Sophomore	Urban Studies/French and Francophone Studies	2016	Urban Studies/French and Francophone Studies	Urban Studies	Non					
Dudley	Ayana	Sociology		French Studies		2nd	1st	3rd	4th	Paris 4 - After reviewing course offerings, I found this university to offer courses that interest me the most in the study of Sociology. I also found this university to offer a rigor that I would be comfortable with.     Paris 3 - There is an emphasis on the study of modern humanity at this university, and this interests me a great amount, as I am looking to compare the styles of sociology offered in the United States versus France. This university also has many courses offered in the Social Science sector, and all the courses I plan to take are in this study.			5th	Paris 4	High school diploma 	2016	United States	Alpharetta 	Georgia	Sophomore	Sociology 	2016	Sociology and French Studies 	Sociology 	Non					
Fowler	Claire	Classical History		French		3rd	1st	4th	5th	Paris 4 is my first choice because I am a classical history major, which focuses heavily on art history as a way to analyze the past. I would love to take an art history class while I am in Paris, and I think Paris 4 would provide the best options for this. Also, I would like to take Latin 1 for my classical history major, and I think Paris 4 would have a good Latin program.    Paris 12 is my second choice because I really like the idea of smaller, more discussion-based classes. I also feel that I could find a good Intro Latin class here.			2nd	Paris 4		2016	United States	Bainbridge Island	Washington	Sophomore	Classical History and French Studies at Wesleyan University	2016	Classical History and French Studies 	Classical History 	Non					
Frechette	Jillian	English		French		3rd	2nd	1st	5th	J'étudie l'anglais/la littérature ainsi que le français, et je crois que Paris 7 et Paris 4 sont les meilleures universités pour cela. J'ai aussi des autres intérêts académiques, particulièrement dans les humanités et les sciences sociales. Je veux faire les course plus interdisciplinaires, au moins dans les départements différents, donc je trouve que la variété offert dans ces universités peut contribuer à cette exploration académique. En outre, je suis une voie de pre-med à Vassar, donc j'ai besoin quelques courses dans les sciences sociales (mais je n'ai pas de suivre des courses des sciences naturelles pendant que je suis en France).			4th	Paris 7	High school diploma	2016	United States	Marlborough	Massachusetts	Junior	English, French and Francophone Studies	2016	English, French and Francophone Studies	Litérrature	Non					
Gikas	Emily	Japanese		French and Francophone Studies		2nd	4th	1st	5th	I would like to study at Paris 7 because of the variety it offers. Since I'm majoring in French, I would like to devote my time in Paris to studying France in various facets, which I believe I can accomplish at Paris 7.  My second choice would be Paris 3 because it offers classes in domains which will be helpful to my studies (like literature).			3rd	Paris 7	High School diploma (Ardsley High School)	2016	United States	Ardsley	New York	Junior	Japanese Major	2016	Japanese Major	French and Francophone Studies	Non

Hebert	Abigail	English		French and Francophone Studies		1st	3rd	5th	4th	Paris 3 and 12 focus on literary studies and the humanities which are my main interests. I chose Paris 3 as my first choice due to its specific focus in literature and the arts, as I also enjoy dance and theatre as other courses of study. Paris 12 also had literature classes, as well as politics which I may obtain a correlate in if I decide to continue my studies in politics in Paris.			2nd	Paris 3	High school diploma	2016	United States	Phoenix	Arizona	Junior	Humanities/ Language Studies	2016	English/ French and Francophone Studies	Literature, History, Dance, Theatre	Non					
Heimler	Daniel	Psychology	Education	English		2nd	3rd	1st	5th	I would really love to study at Paris 7 as my first choice because of the way it aligns with my Psychology major. Psychology is one of my greatest passions, and I have looked all through Paris 7’s offerings, including "Psychopathology" and the history/philosophy of Psychology courses. One of the reasons I wanted to study abroad in France, in addition to the fact that I have taken French for many years and want a deep cultural immersion experience, is that France is one of the last few remaining countries that offers courses on "Psychoanalysis" as a field of study. These are courses I would be extremely interested in and would never be able to take in the US. I have already met and talked with the Psychology Department Head about how exciting of an opportunity this is, and how much of an advantage it could give me with comparative research in cross-cultural psychology practices. I would really thrive at Paris 7 where I can continue my major with courses I have been excited about for months since my discussions with psychology faculty.    My second choice is Paris 3 because I would really enjoy taking French literature and poetry courses while I am abroad. Though my greatest passion is to learn more about psychology and education, I also am very interested in literature. I will also be taking literature courses at Reid Hall, but this will give me the opportunity to take a class in English or have more diversity of course offerings.			4th	Paris 7	High School Diploma	2016	United States	San Diego	California	Sophomore	Psychology, English, Education	2016	Psychology	Psychologie	Non					
Hu	Qingyang (Heropeia)	Economics		French Studies		3rd	1st	2nd	5th	I would like to apply for Paris 4, even though I'm not majoring in art history, because I want to choose one of the courses from their art history department (Vêtement et Mode) provided by the university as my future goal is to work in luxury companies. I think that taking art history (especially costumes history) courses in Paris could help me get familiar with the industry and this would be a very special opportunity for me to learn about Parisian fashion in the heart of the fashion capital. Also, I would like to continue learning Italian during my stay in Paris or take a course in the Geography department, if possible, to dedicate myself in some disciplines that Wesleyan does not offer. I think the relatively comprehensive lists of humanity and social science courses offered by Paris 4 and Paris 7 could be more suitable for me.			4th	Paris 4	High school diploma	2015	China	Shanghai		Senior	Economics, French Studies	2015	Economics, French Studies	Art History	Non					
Hussey	Erin	English		Government		1st	2nd	3rd	5th	Paris 3 is necessary for my government major, as that is pretty much the only university that offers PoliSci classes (Diderot offers only one applicable class in gov't, and I need two).

Kotru Gode	Tanya	French		Psychology		3rd	2nd	1st	5th	1st choice–Paris 7: Being a psychology major, I am interested in the natural science courses offered at Paris 7.

Kusel	Madeleine	Math		Computer Science				1st		I am a math and computer science major, so Diderot would be ideal because they offer the most classes that are relevant to me.

LaCascia	Joseph	Mathematics	Education	French		3rd	2nd	1st	5th	I am interested in taking Sociology classes, hopefully finding ones similar to Education classes at Vassar, and I think Paris 7's Department of Social Sciences will allow me to do this the most easily. It also has a department of mathematics, so if I choose to take a class for my first major, Paris 7 will give me the most luck. There is also a linguistics department; linguistics is a class I wanted to take at Vassar but never had room. At Paris 4, I will be able to take history, which I am interested in and haven't gotten a chance to take at Vassar, yet it still interests me less than sociology, linguistics, and math.			4th	Paris 7	Needham High School Diploma	2016	United States	Needham	Massachusetts	Junior	Mathematics	2016	Mathematics	Sociology, History	Non

J'aimerais bien suivre ses cours de l'histoire du vingtième siècle (comme "Colonisation et décolonisation") et du Judaïsme (comme "Les Juifs et le judaïsme dans l'Antiquité") parce qu'ils seront mais "modules" pour la matière principale d'histoire à Wesleyan. De plus, j'apprends mieux dans des grands cours magistères que les cours qui tournent autour de la discussion. Ma deuxième choix est Paris 7 pour les mêmes raisons, mais les cours de Paris 4 que j'ai régardé m'intéressent les plus.			5th	Paris 4	High school diploma	2016	United States	Chicago	Illinois	Sophomore	History	2016	History	History	Non

I believe that the classes offered at these schools will most effectively enable me to pursue these academic and career-related goals.

There's an art history component to this major, and that's the only thing I was planning on fulfilling abroad, and therefore Paris 4 is basically my only option. I placed Paris 3 second, and that's only because I need a potential second place. So basically, it's Paris 4 as first and everything else as 2nd.

Smith	Ariana	International Studies	Chinese			1st	4th	3rd	5th	My major is International Studies, with concentrations in French and Political Science, so I feel that the "area studies" offered at Paris 3 would be a great fit for me -- I looked at courses which have been offered there in the past, and saw titles such as "Politique internationale," "Construction culturelle des identités nationales," "Institutions et logiques du système politique de l'UE," and "Introduction au droit public," as well as other courses in economics, history, and geography, all of which would tie perfectly into my IS major. Furthermore, Professor Swamy recommended that I attend Paris 3, as he mentioned that the university has a partnership with an institution where I could potentially take Chinese during the second semester (I will be there for the entire year). Paris 12 is my second choice, as it offers courses such as history, political science, geography, foreign languages, and law, which are also relevant to my major.			2nd	Paris 3	High school diploma	2016	United States	Charlottesville	Virginia	Junior	International Studies	2016	International Studies	Études internationales	Non					
Sun	Alex	French and Francophone Studies		Asian Studies		3rd	2nd	1st	5th	Mon premier choix est Paris 7 parce que ma deuxième spécialisation est les études asiatiques, et quand je voyais la brochure, Paris 7 a eu les plus quantité de cours d'études asiatique. Plus spécifiquement, il y a des cours comme l'histoire japonaise et coréenne à Paris 7 que je voudrais suivre qui n'offrent pas à Vassar. En outre, il semble comme la structure d'enseignement est diffèrent en France comparé avec Vassar dans le sens qu'en France, la concentration est sur le profondeur plutôt que la diversité des cours. Et puisque je vais rester en France toute l'année, je pense que c'est plus avantageux de me focaliser sur un sujet. Cela sera aussi m'aide à remplir les unités de valeur nécessaire pour ma spécialisation d'études asiatiques. Mon deuxième choix est Paris 4 parce que je m'intéresse à la sociologie et l'histoire en général. Ce sont les cours que je voudrais étudier si j'ai le temps à Vassar, mais les cours que je ne peux pas suivre parce que je ne peux que suivre les cours pour mes spécialisations. Aussi, je ne sais pas si je pourrais faire cela, mais si c'est possible, je voudrais aussi suivre un cours de japonais à INALCO. Maintenant à Vassar, je suis le cours de japonais de la quatrième année, et je voudrais continuer le suivre en France.			4th	Paris 7	High School Diploma	2016	United States	Scarsdale	New York	Junior	Asian Studies and French and Francophone Studies	2016	Asian Studies and French and Francophone Studies	Asian Studies	Non					
Tennant	Sawyer	English	Film Studies			1st	4th	2nd	5th	Paris 3 is necessary for fulfilling my academic requirements at Wesleyan. It offers courses in cinema and visual arts, which would count as electives for my Film Studies minor, and also has instruction in Arabic, which would allow me to continue my language studies abroad (I am currently enrolled in Intermediate Arabic II at Wesleyan). Additionally, it has an abundance of literary studies courses that would interest me if Film or Arabic did not work out.    I got a B1 on the TCF, so Paris 7 is no longer an option.    I would be perfectly happy at Paris 12, so long as I am able to take a film course there or at Reid Hall.			3rd	Paris 3	High school diploma	2016	United States	Los Angeles	California	Junior	Wesleyan/English	2016	English (Film minor)	English/Film	Non
